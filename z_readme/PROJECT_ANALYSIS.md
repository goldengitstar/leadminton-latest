# Leadminton Project Analysis & Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Leadminton is a badminton club management simulation game. Based on the client chat analysis and current codebase review, the project needs significant backend (admin system) and frontend (interclub system) development to meet the client's requirements.

**Current Status**: Core game mechanics implemented, but missing critical admin system and complete interclub functionality.

**Client Priority**: Backend admin system (back office) is the highest priority for the current milestone.

## Client Requirements Analysis (From WhatsApp Chat)

### **Critical Requirements (Must Have)**

#### 1. **Back Office / Admin System** 
- **Budget**: $750 for backend completion
- **Purpose**: Admin control over tournaments and interclub seasons
- **Features Required**:
  - Create tournaments on desired dates
  - Manage CPU player names, rankings, and team assignments
  - Launch interclub seasons with 48-hour registration deadlines
  - Assign real players and CPU teams to groups
  - View player activity logs
  - View tournament results
  - Change user passwords
  - Route: `/admin` or similar

#### 2. **Enhanced Interclub System**
- **Current**: Basic UI exists but incomplete functionality
- **Required**: Complete seasonal competition system
- **Key Features**:
  - Team registration with 5 players (minimum 2 men, 2 women)
  - 5-match format per team encounter:
    - Men's Singles (1 player)
    - Women's Singles (1 player)
    - Men's Doubles (2 players)
    - Women's Doubles (2 players)
    - Mixed Doubles (1 man + 1 woman) - needs gender validation
  - Group-based competition (6-8 teams per group)
  - Weekly matches over 1-month season
  - Team vs team scoring (e.g., "Team A wins 3-2")
  - Group standings and rankings
  - CPU teams to fill groups
  - Player deletion for 100,000 coins
  - "Team waiting for review" screen after lineup submission

#### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**
- **Client feedback**: Current design "looks like internet from 1910"
- **Required**: Modern, responsive design
- **Specific issues**: Tournament registration form not working on mobile
- **Need**: Complete main page redesign

### **Client Business Logic Requirements**

#### **Interclub Season Flow**:
1. Admin launches season from back office
2. 48-hour registration window for teams
3. Teams register with 5 players (2 men, 2 women minimum)
4. Admin assigns teams to groups and fills with CPU
5. Season runs for 1 month with weekly matches
6. Each team plays others in group (home/away)
7. Results tracked, rankings updated
8. End-of-season rewards distributed

#### **Tournament Management**:
- Admin creates tournaments with custom entry fees
- CPU players added to fill brackets
- 5 tournament levels: departmental, regional, national, international, World Selection
- Prize pools managed from admin panel

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Player management (recruitment, training, equipment)
- Resource system (coins, shuttlecocks, meals, diamonds)
- Tournament system (registration, brackets, simulation)
- Quick match system
- Facilities and manager systems
- Database schema with Supabase
- User authentication
- Player stats and strategy system

### üöß **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- **Interclub system**: UI exists but missing core functionality
- **Tournament system**: Works but needs admin management
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Some pages not working properly

### ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED (CRITICAL)**
- **Admin/Back office system**: Complete absence
- **Interclub match execution**: No team vs team matches
- **Interclub season management**: No scheduling or group management
- **Modern UI design**: Client rejected current design
- **CPU team management**: No admin interface

## Technical Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Backend/Admin System (Priority 1)**
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days (compressed)
**Budget**: $750

#### Database Schema Additions:
```sql
-- Admin system
CREATE TABLE admin_users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- CPU teams
CREATE TABLE cpu_teams (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  skill_level integer DEFAULT 1,
  players jsonb NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Interclub seasons
CREATE TABLE interclub_seasons (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  start_date timestamptz NOT NULL,
  registration_deadline timestamptz NOT NULL,
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  groups jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Team registrations
CREATE TABLE interclub_registrations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  season_id uuid REFERENCES interclub_seasons(id),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  players jsonb NOT NULL,
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### Admin Interface Components:
- `AdminDashboard` - Main admin overview
- `TournamentManager` - Create/edit tournaments
- `InterclubManager` - Launch seasons, manage groups
- `CpuTeamManager` - Manage CPU players and teams
- `UserManager` - View users, change passwords
- `ActivityLogs` - System activity monitoring

### **Phase 2: Essential Interclub Fixes (Priority 2)**
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days (compressed)

#### Key Components:
- `InterclubRegistration` - Team registration with validation
- `InterclubSeason` - Active season management
- `TeamVsTeamMatch` - 5-match simulation system
- `InterclubStandings` - Group rankings
- `LineupManager` - Change players between matches

#### Match Simulation Logic:
```typescript
interface TeamMatch {
  homeTeam: Team;
  awayTeam: Team;
  matches: {
    mensSingles: Match;
    womensSingles: Match;
    mensDoubles: Match;
    womensDoubles: Match;
    mixedDoubles: Match;
  };
  winner: Team;
  score: string; // "3-2", "4-1", etc.
}
```

### **Phase 3: Critical Testing & Deployment (Priority 3)**
**Estimated Time**: 1 day
- End-to-end testing of core features
- Critical bug fixes only
- Client review and deployment

**Note**: UI/UX improvements, advanced features, and comprehensive testing postponed to next milestone due to 1-week constraint.

- [ ] Admin user seeding script

### **Day 3-4: Core Admin Features (Essential)**
- [ ] Tournament management interface (create/edit tournaments)
- [ ] CPU team basic management
- [ ] Interclub season creation
- [ ] User management (password changes)

### **Day 5-6: Interclub System Fixes (Client Priority)**
- [ ] Fix Mixed Doubles validation (1 male + 1 female)
- [ ] Add "Team waiting for review" screen
- [ ] Basic team vs team match simulation (5-match format)
- [ ] Registration deadline implementation

### **Day 7: Testing & Critical Fixes**
- [ ] End-to-end testing of admin workflows
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness critical fixes
- [ ] Client review and bug fixes
- [ ] Deployment preparation

**Note**: UI/UX improvements postponed to future milestone to meet 1-week deadline.

## Budget Breakdown

- **Backend/Admin System**: $750
- **Frontend Completion**: $1,250 (on time) / $750 (late)
- **Total Available**: $2,000 (on time) / $1,500 (late)

## Risk Assessment

### **High Risk**:
- Complex interclub season management logic
- Admin system security implementation
- Client design approval process

### **Medium Risk**:
- Team vs team match simulation complexity
- Mobile responsiveness challenges
- Database performance with multiple concurrent seasons

### **Low Risk**:
- Basic CRUD operations for admin
- UI component development
- Existing code integration

## Success Metrics

3. **Users can register teams and participate in seasons**
4. **Match simulation works for both individual and team formats**
5. **Responsive design works on all devices**
6. **Client approves modern UI design**
7. **No critical bugs or performance issues**

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start admin system development
2. **Week 1**: Complete admin authentication and basic dashboard
3. **Week 2**: Implement tournament and CPU team management
4. **Week 3**: Begin interclub season management
5. **Ongoing**: Regular client communication and feedback sessions
