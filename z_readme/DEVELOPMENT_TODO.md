## üìä TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Match Simulation Logic
```typescript
// New team match interface needed
interface TeamMatch {
  homeTeam: Team;
  awayTeam: Team;
  matches: {
    mensSingles: IndividualMatch;
    womensSingles: IndividualMatch;
    mensDoubles: IndividualMatch;
    womensDoubles: IndividualMatch;
    mixedDoubles: IndividualMatch;
  };

}
```

### Database Relationships
```sql
-- Key relationships to implement
interclub_registrations.season_id -> interclub_seasons.id
interclub_matches.season_id -> interclub_seasons.id
interclub_matches.home_team_id -> interclub_registrations.id OR cpu_teams.id
admin_users.user_id -> auth.users.id
