[7:38 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: In here we should be able to choose and add our players for 5 match‚Äôs such as :

Men single : (input one guy)
Women single :(input one girl)
Men‚Äôs double : (input two men)
Women‚Äôs double : (input two women)

[7:40 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: In order to launch a new interclub season we should have total of 5 players but need at least 2 girls and 2 men‚Äôs
[7:40 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: the teams should be random cpu teams?
[7:42 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: -We also need to be able to delete one player if we pay 100.000 coins

[7:43 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Nope. We need to manage this from back office. 

Like user register his team, and the season will start after 48 hours (in the meantime we set the groups on the back office and complete with cpu if needed)

[7:48 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Did you changed IV to maximum 999 ?
[7:49 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: sorry, IV meaning?

[7:52 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Yep like /admin or something
[7:53 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: 999 is 0.5%
[7:54 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Yes but did you understand the system
[7:55 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: yes, almost understandable.
[7:59 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: And I think we should build back office first.
[7:59 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: What do you think?
[8:03 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Maybe
[8:03 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Why not
[8:09 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: And then please let's clear the payments.
[8:09 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: from now, I will start building back office.
[8:10 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: What do you mean ?
[8:11 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: interclubs is for 750$ and back office is for 500$?

[8:13 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: And we have seen nothing about it
[8:14 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: yes, we have to build back office from scratch.
[8:15 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: so I think it's enough for 500$.
[8:15 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: What 500 ?
[8:16 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: I mean back office

[8:16 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Yes. And what ?
[8:16 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Please clarify
[8:17 AM, 4/8/2025] Carson Gale: oh, you misunderstand me. interclub + back office is for 750$ + 500$. And last milestone is for 750$.

[8:18 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: So next one is 750$
[8:18 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: And after maybe 1250$
[8:18 AM, 4/8/2025] +66 98 017 0388: Probably

Leadminton is a sports management simulation game where players take on the role of a badminton club manager. The goal of the game is to create, develop, and manage your own club by recruiting players and having them participate in instant matches, interclub competitions, and tournaments..


Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Club Creation and Management: The player begins as the manager of a badminton club and must manage the financial, logistical, and human resources aspects to grow and improve their team.
‚Ä¢ Player Recruitment: The manager recruits players. They can adjust training, strategies, and role allocation within the team.
‚Ä¢ Instant Matches: The game offers quick matches where managers can test their recruits' skills. These matches allow them to earn points and unlock small resources to advance the club.
‚Ä¢ Tournaments: Managers can register their players for tournaments of different levels. The higher the competitions, the greater the rewards, but the higher the registration fee. There are five levels of tournaments: departmental, regional, national, international, and World Selection.
‚Ä¢ Interclub: Managers can also register a team for interclub play; the team must consist of at least 3 women and 4 men. There are four interclub championships: departmental, regional, national, and top 12. Each championship requires certain prerequisites to launch. An interclub championship season lasts one month, and a group is composed of 6-8 interclub teams.
‚Ä¢ Reward levels and classes: As previously stated, competitions are organized into several levels and categories. Depending on the performance of the club and its players, the manager can access in-game rewards if they win a quick match, a tournament, or an interclub season (virtual currency, in-game equipment, bonuses), as well as exclusive physical rewards related to the world of badminton, such as exclusive rackets, equipment signed by top players, tickets to the Badminton World Championships, tickets to the best badminton camps, and much more!
‚Ä¢ Progression and development: The game offers a progression system for both players and the club, with different levels of experience and ranking. Managers must optimize strategy, manage resources and maintain good momentum to move their team to the top of global competitions.
Leadminton combines strategy, management, and a passion for sport, offering players an immersive experience in the competitive world of badminton with challenges worthy of the best sports managers!


1.	Le DASHBOARD:

This is where you will see an overview of the club, you will be able to see our players, current and upcoming competitions as well as production information from our facilities

2. Mon club.

In the club we can manage everything that concerns our players, namely their physical and technical abilities, their equipment as well as the subjective settings allowing us to match the players' skills with the game strategies. (It may seem complicated but it's really simple, I'll show you how below)
By clicking on the blue weight, I access this menu that allows me to view and improve my players' physical skills. Here I find endurance, power, agility, speed, explosiveness, and injury prevention.
If I have the necessary resources, I can click on one of these physical qualities to improve it.

For example, I paid 5 shuttlecocks, 3 meals, and 50 coins to upgrade my stamina to level 1. (It was level 0).
Then we find the purple lungs, which represent our technical abilities!
By clicking on them, and provided we have the necessary resources, we can upgrade our technical skills:
The smash is currently being improved‚Ä¶
If you click on the green t-shirt, you can see the player's equipment (the images in the example are not accurate, of course).
Each piece of equipment offers something extra to the player; it's wise to choose them carefully. 

If you click on the green t-shirt, you can see the player's equipment (the images in the example are not accurate, of course).
Each piece of equipment brings something extra to the player; it's wise to choose them carefully.

Now we come to the subjective settings:
To explain this in a nutshell, it's quite simple. There are 12 sliders corresponding to the players' 12 physical and technical stats. The goal is to match each slider to each physical or technical trait.

For example, physical involvement is directly linked to endurance.
If a player has 90% endurance, they should rate their physical involvement at 9/10.
If they don't, they lose consistency points. (Of course, the player doesn't know this.)
The higher the consistency score, the more likely the player is to win their matches, as this variable represents 40% of a match's outcome (50% total player score, 40% strategy, and 10% ranking).

On the tournament page, you can view upcoming and ongoing tournaments, with the option to see the rewards for winning. You'll see a countdown timer, entry fees, and tournament types (departmental, regional, national, international, and World Selection).

Players can register if they have the necessary resources.

Tournaments will include between 10 and 64 players. We need the ability to add bots (from the back office, to be able to create tournaments as we wish).
The quick match tab is probably the simplest.

We select a player, pay the resources needed to participate (not yet paid, but you get the idea).
And we start the match. (This is a random match whose outcome is randomly generated.)

The match result is launched and will be determined randomly. In case of defeat, the player wins nothing; in case of victory, they can earn some resources. Here, the player has won, so he receives some coins and a diamond (in reality, the rewards will be random).

Here we are on the interclub pre-season page.

The player has the option to register a team for interclub competition. He needs a minimum number of players, a minimum number of coins, a minimum number of shuttlecocks, and a minimum amount of food.

If he has the necessary resources, he can launch an interclub season; the season will last 30 days. The player will have his team placed in a pool (a group) of 6-8 teams.

There will be home and away matches, so for example, in a group of 6, each team will play 10 matches per month (5 home matches against the other teams in the group and 5 return matches).

Once the season starts, the interclub menu will look like this: in the top left, you'll see the club's players, in the top right, the next match, in the bottom left, the end-of-season rewards for the winning teams, and in the bottom right, the rankings of the best teams in the group.

In the Facilities tab, you'll find all the facilities that can be upgraded to increase resource production. You can also temporarily recruit one or more managers to boost production in a given area.
Here we are in the shop, where the player can buy diamonds, recruit (again) the 3 managers, buy the official game T-shirt (physical), and also purchase resources with diamonds. We want to make resources and especially diamonds quite rare, which is why we are working on the game economy.
‚Äî‚Äî
It is a badminton management game in which the user creates their club, recruits players, trains them (which requires resources), and has them participate in quick matches, interclub competitions, and tournaments.
Each player has an IV (a potential level), meaning they have base stats that are more or less high. They can improve their technical skills, their technique, and also buy accessories to enhance their abilities.
The user can participate in quick matches, possibly earning resources if they win.
Registering for tournaments has a resource cost, which will be decided by us from the back office.
Registering for interclub competitions also comes with a significant resource cost.


And this part is description about the project.

So I need following.

First, analyze the chat with client and the project description to findout what functions the client wants now and what I have to do.
Second, anyalze the current project implemented code and  make a list of current implemented functions, missing functions about the client's need, and the todo list with specific approch.

in general, I want a full document about the project's functionality, client's requirements' and the solution for it.
