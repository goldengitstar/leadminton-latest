# Tournament Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the requested tournament features:

1. **Resource deduction during user tournament registration**
2. **Automatic prize distribution when tournaments complete**
3. **Admin player registration without resource deduction**

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. Resource Deduction for Tournament Registration

**Database Implementation:**
- Enhanced `register_player_for_tournament()` function in `supabase/migrations/20250617000000_admin_system_setup.sql`
- Automatically deducts entry fees from user resources when they register for tournaments
- Creates negative resource transactions with source `'tournament_registration'`
- Supports all resource types: coins, shuttlecocks, meals, diamonds

**Frontend Changes:**
- Updated `src/pages/TournamentsPage.tsx` to remove manual resource deduction
- Resource deduction is now handled server-side for better security and consistency
- Maintains existing resource validation in the UI

### 2. Automatic Prize Distribution

**Database Implementation:**
- Enhanced `distribute_tournament_rewards()` function
- Automatically distributes prizes when tournaments complete
- Creates positive resource transactions with source `'tournament_reward'`
- Awards prizes to 1st and 2nd place winners
- Only distributes rewards to real players (not CPU players)
- Updates user tournament registration records with final positions

**Key Features:**
- Automatic execution when tournaments complete
- Real-time resource balance updates via materialized view refresh
- Proper tracking of reward distribution status

### 3. Admin Player Registration

**Database Implementation:**
- New `admin_register_player_for_tournament()` function
- Allows admins to register any player (real or CPU) without resource deduction
- Includes `p_force_registration` parameter to override tournament capacity limits
- Tracks registration source (`'admin'` vs `'user'`)

**Frontend Implementation:**
- New `PlayerRegistrationModal` component in `src/components/admin/PlayerRegistrationModal.tsx`
- Integrated into `TournamentForm` component for admin use
- Supports both real players and CPU players
- Search functionality and tabbed interface

-- Admin registration without resource deduction  
admin_register_player_for_tournament(p_tournament_id uuid, p_player_id uuid, p_force_registration boolean)

-- Enhanced prize distribution
distribute_tournament_rewards(p_tournament_id uuid)
```

**Resource Transaction Sources:**
- `tournament_registration` - Entry fee deductions
- `tournament_reward` - Prize distributions

### Performance Considerations
- Materialized view refresh after reward distribution
- Indexed resource transactions for fast queries
- Efficient tournament status checking

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of insufficient resources
- Proper error messages for registration failures
- Rollback support for failed operations

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Game Context
